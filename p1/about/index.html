    <p>The Velvet-Velvet is a open and inclusive private museum of design and scholarship that features work ranging from legendary artists of the past century to the latest bleeding edge and underground developments of the present day art world.Every year, we feature three to four larger shows about graphic design and architecture, with smaller monthly exhibits featuring work from local designers. Nothing on display will be for sale. The Velvet Velvet is like a free private museum of design scholarship meant to appeal to the whims of its foundersâ€”and hopefully the community.</p>
